## Introductions

* [RDF 1.1 Primer](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/): For some standards the W3C provides so called "Primers". This is always what you want to read before you dig deeper into a domain, as it gives a great overview with examples and not just pure formal specification. The RDF Primer provides an up-to-date introduction into RDF 1.1.

## References (selection only)

This section provides links to several RDF related standards, mostly from W3C. This is by no means a complete list, its focus is on the most important standards to start with.

* [SPARQL 1.1 Query Language](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/)
